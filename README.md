You cannot directly paste the code in turbo c++
So 1st open Turbo c++ and create new program by any name in turbo c
Now go to the directory folder of turbo c++ in My computer
then click on BIN folder 
search for program file u have created previously (it will have an extension of .cpp )
then right click on the file and click on Edit (it will open in notepad)                                                
Copy the code of program from Github in repositaries
then paste it in the opened notepad and save it (of ur program file)
close the notepad and again open turbo c++
And now click on open in file section
and open the program file u have saved 
the program will be copied 
Thank me later :)
